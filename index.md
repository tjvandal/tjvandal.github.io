description: Machine Learning, Data Science, and Earth Sciences

---

My research is at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, Earth science, and high-performance computing. I am interested in machine learning applications to our ever growing datastores of spatio-temporal Earth science observations, forecasts, and projections for climate mitigation and adaptation. Recent projects have included developments of novel deep learning methods for atmospheric wind, climate downscaling, emulation, virtual sensing, and cloud tracking. 

## Bio

Thomas is a research scientist at the [NASA Ames Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/) and [Bay Area Environmental Research Institute](https://baeri.org/) within the [NASA Earth eXchange (NEX)](https://www.nasa.gov/nex) in Mountain View, CA. He is the Principle Investigator (PI) of a NASA ROSES grant studying optical flow methodologies for tracking atmospheric motion in satellite imagery. Thomas earned a Ph.D. in Interdisciplinary Engineering from Northeastern University in 2018 while working in the [Sustainability and Data Sciences Lab](https://web.northeastern.edu/sds/) advised by [Auroop R. Ganguly](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/ganguly-auroop/). Prior to graduate school he worked at startups in the Boston area, including the MIT Media Lab spin-out Affectiva.  He completed his bachelors in mathematics at the University of Maryland College Park in 2012.
